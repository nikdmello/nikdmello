# Hi, I'm Nik

Previously worked on TownSq, a SaaS platform for HOA management serving millions of users.

Some things I’ve worked on:

• **Event-driven data sync service** for processing large workloads at scale (AWS Lambda, EventBridge, DynamoDB, SQS, .NET)  
• **Full-stack platform for automating database schema deployments** (Angular, NestJS, AWS)  
• **Serverless OAuth 2.0 authentication gateway** for internal applications  
• **Cloud governance automation** to map AWS resources into Port for visibility and compliance
